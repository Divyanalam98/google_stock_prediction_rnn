In this repository, we leverage the power of deep learning and sequential modeling with RNNs to forecast the future prices of Google's stock.
RNNs are well-suited for time series prediction tasks, allowing the model to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in stock price data. 
With historical stock prices as input, our trained RNN model can generate accurate predictions of future price movements.
